# rix
Initial development on Rix scripting language for writers

## Overview
Rix is a minimal library that allows for generative language extensions in standard JavasScript strings.
An example:

```js
let a = `A basic JavaScript string`
```
```
let a = rix`A [rix | special | expanded]  JavaScript string`
```
